# Visualisation Project - Tableau Public Dashboard

**Goal:** To create Interactive Tableau Dashboard according to the Draft.

**Project Description**

Let's take alook at the draft:

</p>
The date and time filter and country filter should modify all of the dashboard's graphs. Note that the interaction history graphs "Trending History" and "Trending History, %" should have date and time along the X axis. "Trending History" should have the number of videos in the trending section (the videos_count field) along the Y axis, and the other graph should have the percentage there.

To build the dashboard, complete the following steps:

In Tableau Public, use trending_by_time.csv to create a dashboard modeled on the draft.

Publish the dashboard on the Tableau Public server. Make sure it's available for the entire internet: try opening it in several browsers. 

Use your dashboard to answer the questions the managers asked you:

- Which video categories trended most often?
- How were they distributed among regions?
- What categories were especially popular in the United States? Were there any differences between the categories popular in the US and those popular elsewhere?
