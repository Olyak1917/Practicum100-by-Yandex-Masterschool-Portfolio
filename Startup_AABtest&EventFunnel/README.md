## Project for a startup that sells food products - Sales Funnel (Conversion) Study, A/A/B Test Results Analysing
**Technologies and Tools** - Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scipy

**Project Description**


**Goal:** To investigate user behavior for the company's app.

You work at a startup that sells food products. You need to investigate user behavior for the company's app.
First study the sales funnel. Find out how users reach the purchase stage. How many users actually make it to this stage? How many get stuck at previous stages? Which stages in particular?

Then look at the results of an A/A/B test. The designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, but the managers are afraid the users might find the new design intimidating. They decide to make a decision based on the results of an A/A/B test.

The users are split into three groups: two control groups get the old fonts and one test group gets the new ones. Find out which set of fonts produces better results.

Creating two A groups has certain advantages. We can make it a principle that we will only be confident in the accuracy of our testing when the two control groups are similar. If there are significant differences between the A groups, this can help us uncover factors that may be distorting the results. Comparing control groups also tells us how much time and data we'll need when running further tests.

**Conclusion**

Based on results of our research we can conclude that changing of the fonts did not make noticeable influence on usersâ€™ behavior. So we would recommend letting designers keep looking for approaches that will work. Also we would recommend investigating potential problems on stage between MainScreenAppear and OffersScreenAppear where the conversion is the weakest.
