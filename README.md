# Project for a startup that sells food products - Sales Funnel (Conversion) Study, A/A/B Test Results Analysing

**Technologies and Tools** - Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scipy


**Goal:** To investigate user behavior for the company's app.

**Project Description**

You work at a startup that sells food products. You need to investigate user behavior for the company's app.

First study the sales funnel. Find out how users reach the purchase stage. How many users actually make it to this stage? How many get stuck at previous stages? Which stages in particular?

Then look at the results of an A/A/B test. The designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, but the managers are afraid the users might find the new design intimidating. They decide to make a decision based on the results of an A/A/B test.

The users are split into three groups: two control groups get the old fonts and one test group gets the new ones. Find out which set of fonts produces better results.

Creating two A groups has certain advantages. We can make it a principle that we will only be confident in the accuracy of our testing when the two control groups are similar. If there are significant differences between the A groups, this can help us uncover factors that may be distorting the results. Comparing control groups also tells us how much time and data we'll need when running further tests.

# SQL Project - Sturtup on Apps for Book Lovers
**Technologies and Tools** - Python, Jupyter, PostgreSQL, Sqlalchemy, Pandas


**Goal:** The project goal is to generate a value proposition for a new product.

**Project Description**

The coronavirus took the entire world by surprise, changing everyone's daily routine. City dwellers no longer spent their free time outside, going to cafes and malls; more people were at home, reading books. That attracted the attention of startups that rushed to develop new apps for book lovers. 

You've been given a database of one of the services competing in this market. It contains data on books, publishers, authors, and customer ratings and reviews of books. This information will be used to generate a value proposition for a new product.

**Task**

- Find the number of books released after January 1, 2000.
- Find the number of user reviews and the average rating for each book.
- Identify the publisher that has released the greatest number of books with more than 50 pages (this will help you exclude brochures and similar publications from your analysis).
- Identify the author with the highest average book rating (look only at books with at least 50 ratings).
- Find the average number of text reviews among users who rated more than 50 books.
## Conclusion
We would recommend that new product focus on books, released after year 2000, with a reviews from users who rated more than 50 books, and high ratings (>=4), paying special attention on books, published by Penguin Books. No need to say that J.K. Rowling is a must for every books app.

# Visualisation Project - Tableau Public Dashboard

**Goal:** To create Interactive Tableau Dashboard according to the Draft.

**Project Description**

Let's take alook at the draft:
<p align="center">
    <img src=Tableau_Public_Project\draft_dashboard.png width=500>
</p>
The date and time filter and country filter should modify all of the dashboard's graphs. Note that the interaction history graphs "Trending History" and "Trending History, %" should have date and time along the X axis. "Trending History" should have the number of videos in the trending section (the videos_count field) along the Y axis, and the other graph should have the percentage there.


To build the dashboard, complete the following steps:

In Tableau Public, use trending_by_time.csv to create a dashboard modeled on the draft.

Publish the dashboard on the Tableau Public server. Make sure it's available for the entire internet: try opening it in several browsers. 

Use your dashboard to answer the questions the managers asked you:

- Which video categories trended most often?
- How were they distributed among regions?
- What categories were especially popular in the United States? Were there any differences between the categories popular in the US and those popular elsewhere?
